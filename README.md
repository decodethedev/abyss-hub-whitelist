This is a "shit" whitelist, so please don't try to use it in your projects, this is just for new people who wants to learn, and this is not even good, but it could be a resource for their projects. This is an old version of Abyss whitelist, I couldn't find the latest one, however it will be a good learning resource for anyone who wants to get started in this field or any. ( and yes very messy codes and bad practices ik, its very old. )
